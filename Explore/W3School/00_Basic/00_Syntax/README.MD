# Code Explained

---

### Line 1

```c++
  #include <iostream>
```

Is a **header** that lets us work with input and output objects, such as `cout` (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.

### Line 2

```c++
  using namespace std;
```

Means that we can use names for object and variables from the standard library.

### Line 3

White space C++ ignores white space, but white space make the code more readable

### Line 4

```c++
  int main()
```

Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is `int main()`. This called a **function**. Any code inside its curly brackets `{}` will be executed.

### Line 6

```c++
  cout<<"Hello world";
```

cout (pronounced "see out") print/output after `<<` statement in this case we print "Hello world" in the program

### Line 7

```c++
  return 0;
```

This is a return value of our function.

### Line 8

```c++
  }
```

We begin with `{` end with `}` this mean the code will execute everything inside curly bracket its called function body.

### Line 10

```c++
  // Congratulations!
```

Comment in c++ begin with `//` and it not will be execute in by the program. it's just comment for Human. :D

> **Note :** Don't forget semicolon in the end of statement
